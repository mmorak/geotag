Version 0.033 of the Geotag program has just been released.

Geotag is a platform independent, GUI based application that compares date/time
information captured by a digital camera with tracks recorded by a GPS unit and
matches them up. You can then store the location with your digital photos and
easily always know exactly where an image was taken.
Geotag allows fine tuning of locations in external programs like Google Maps 
in a web browser or Google Earth.

New features:
Geotag now supports reverse geocoding. It used the webservice of geonames.org
to assign city, state/province and country names to images that already have
coordinates.
Another new feature is the ability to display location markers for nearby
locations with Wikipedia articles on the Google map.
