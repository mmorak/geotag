Version 0.024 of the Geotag program has just been released.

Geotag is a platform independent, GUI based application that compares date/time
information captured by a digital camera with tracks recorded by a GPS unit and
matches them up. You can then store the location with your digital photos and
easily always know exactly where an image was taken.
Geotag allows fine tuning of locations in external programs like Google Maps 
in a web browser or Google Earth.

Major new feature:
More than one image can now be adjusted on a single Google Map. This reduces the
number of Maps that need to be opened in the web browser, resulting in faster
work flow and reduced memory usage.

program is all about.
